####*Video 1.2 - Asset Returns*

**A. Asset Return Calculations**

- Net return: % change over some period (i.e. "the holding period return")
- Gross return: Net return + inital investment (i.e. principal)
- (x-a)/a = (x/a)-1

**B. Multi-Period Returns**

- *n*-period return = V*(1+r)^n^-V
- The two-period return is the geometric (multiplicative) average of two one-period returns
- Two-month (or any multi-period) returns are not additive
- There is a *multiplicative* relationship between successive returns
- To reiterate: a *k*-month return is the geometric average of *k* one-month returns

####*Video 1.3 - Portfolio Returns*

**A. Portfolio Returns**

- A portfolio is composed of some investment distributed amongst multiple assets
- Some notataion
    - *V* = total investment
    - *x~A~* & *x~B~* = shares in A and B, respectively
- Portfolio returns *are* additive
    - 1-period return on the portfolio is given by:
    - *R~p,t~* = *x~A~* *R~A,t~* + *x~B~* *R~B,t~*
- Portolfio returns are linear combinations of returns on underlying securities

**B. A Generalized Form of This Relationship**

- *R~p,t~* = sum(*x~i~* *R~i,t~*)
- Down the road, matrix algebra will help us with these relationships
- We'll be able to consider a vector of weights and another vector of returns

####*Video 1.4 - Dividends*

**A. Adjusting for Dividends**

- Real returns to equities come from some combination of capital gains and dividends
- Return = %change in P + *D~t~*/*P~t-1~*
    - That is, capital gain + "dividend yield"

####*Video 1.5 - Inflation*

**A. Adjusting for Inflation**

- This adjustment leads to calculation of "real" rates of return
- Common price indices: CPI, PCE
    - "core" versions of these have volatile portions (food, energy) taken out
- Deflate the price: (nominal_price)/CPI
- You can break this down algebraically to find an interesting relationship:
    - realreturn = (1 + nominalreturn) / (1 + % change in inflation) - 1
- The point here is to evaluate the new purchasing power you gain from your investment growing
    - This is preferable to just calculating the new dollars you've earned
- Higher inflation = lower real returns (for a given % change in nominal price)

####*Video 1.6 - Annualizing Returns*

**A. Annualizing Returns**

- Annualizing is basically converting your period into years, compounding, and finding future value
- Compound annual rate of return for a monthly rate of return
    - *R~A~* = (1+*r~t~*)^(*t*) - 1
    
**B. Annualized two-year returns**

- What if you have an investment with a two-year return, and you want to find the CAGR?
- CAGR = (value~end~/value~start~)^(1/*t*)-1
    - where *t* is the number of years that passed between the beginning and end dates
    
**C. A Note on Continous Compounding**

- Continously compounded returns are additive
- So, if you have a monthly continuous return and you want to convert it to an annual return...
- ... you need to *multiply* the monthly cc return by 12

####*Video 1.7 - Continuously Compounded Returns*

**A. Continuous Compounding**

- continuously compounded returns are attractive because they are:
    a. computationally simple
    b. additive
- r~t~ = ln(1 + R~t~) = ln(P~t~/P~t-1~)
- Simple return = e^r~t~^ - 1
- the continuously compounded return is always a smaller number than the simple return

**B. Some Log and Exponential Rules**

- ln(0) = -\infinity
- ln(1) = 0
- ln(e^x^)=x, e^ln(x)^=x
- ln(x^y^) = y ln(x)

**C. Intuition**

- The continuously compounded return is just the continuously compounded growth rate of prices between two periods
- If the simple rate of return is small (close to 0), ln(1 + R~t~) is approximately R~t~
- continuously compounded return is just dlog(price)
- in macro, we plot the logarithm to show % changes (elasticity)
    - slope of log graph is the growth rate between two time periods

**D. Multi-period Returns**

- continuously compounded returns are additive (not multiplicative like simple returns)

####*Video 1.8 - Portfolio Returns and Inflation*

**A. Portfolio Returns**

- Return on a portfolio is just a weighted average of returns on component assets of the portfolio
- CC portfolio return is still ln(1 + sum(simple returns))
- CC portolfio returns are *not* simply a weighted average of CC returns on individual assets in the portfolio
    - the CC portfolio return is equal to ln(1+ weighted average(simple returns))
    - ln(1 + simple return)

**B. Adjusting for Inflation**

- this is easier when working with cc returns
- The real return is just r~t~ - pi~t~^cc^
- the real continuously compounded return = nominal cc return - cc inflation growth (log diff in CPI)

####*Video 1.9 - Simple Returns (Excel Example)*

**A. Asset Return Calculations in Excel**

- "the world runs through an Excel spreadsheet"

####*Video 1.10 - Getting Financial Data from Yahoo!*

**A. Yahoo!**

- provides a lot of free historical data
- others: Microsoft Money, Google, Oanda
- this course uses data from Yahoo! Finance
- NASDAQ = "national association of Security Dealers Automated Quoting System"
- Bid and Ask
    - You buy from brokers at the Ask price, you sell to the Broker at the Bid price
    - Bid-Ask spread is profit for the broker on a "round-trip" transaction
- plenty of data (down to daily frequency) in the "historical prices" portion of Yahoo
- "Adjusted Close" is the closing price adjusted for dividends and stock splits
- Stock splits can cause a big change in the spot price
- the "adjusted price" from Yahoo automatically accounts for splits and dividends
- note that the price data from Yahoo is artificialy rounded to two digits, so returns may be biased due to measurement error

####*Video 1.11 - Return Calculations in Excel*

**A. Doing Return Calcs in Excel**

- You can hit the "fx" button by the command bar in Excel to get organized lists of functions
- This will also give you links to help articles on various functions

####*Video 1.12 - Growth of $1*

**A. Looking at returns in Excel**

- Rates of return are asymmetric by definition
    - After losing 50%, you'd need a 100% return on your new balance to cancel out that loss
    - In addition, losses cannot go below -100%, but gains are theoretically unbounded
- a "growth of a dollar" graph is, in some contexts, a more useful visualization that a graph of % changes in the price
    - such curves, more formally known as "equity curves", allow you so see trend and cycle components a bit more easily
- this is like "normalizing the price to start at 1"
