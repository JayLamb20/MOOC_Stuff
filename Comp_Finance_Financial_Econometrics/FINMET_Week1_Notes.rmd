####*Video 1.2 - Asset Returns*

**A. Asset Return Calculations**

- Net return: % change over some period (i.e. "the holding period return")
- Gross return: Net return + inital investment (i.e. principal)
- (x-a)/a = (x/a)-1

**B. Multi-Period Returns**

- *n*-period return = V*(1+r)^n^-V
- The two-period return is the geometric (multiplicative) average of two one-period returns
- Two-month (or any multi-period) returns are not additive
- There is a *multiplicative* relationship between successive returns
- To reiterate: a *k*-month return is the geometric average of *k* one-month returns

####*Video 1.3 - Portfolio Returns*

**A. Portfolio Returns**

- A portfolio is composed of some investment distributed amongst multiple assets
- Some notataion
    - *V* = total investment
    - *x~A~* & *x~B~* = shares in A and B, respectively
- Portfolio returns *are* additive
    - 1-period return on the portfolio is given by:
    - *R~p,t~* = *x~A~* *R~A,t~* + *x~B~* *R~B,t~*
- Portolfio returns are linear combinations of returns on underlying securities

**B. A Generalized Form of This Relationship**

- *R~p,t~* = sum(*x~i~* *R~i,t~*)
- Down the road, matrix algebra will help us with these relationships
- We'll be able to consider a vector of weights and another vector of returns

####*Video 1.4 - Dividends*

**A. Adjusting for Dividends**

- Real returns to equities come from some combination of capital gains and dividends
- Return = %change in P + *D~t~*/*P~t-1~*
    - That is, capital gain + "dividend yield"

####*Video 1.5 - Inflation*

**A. Adjusting for Inflation**

- This adjustment leads to calculation of "real" rates of return
- Common price indices: CPI, PCE
    - "core" versions of these have volatile portions (food, energy) taken out
- Deflate the price: (nominal_price)/CPI
- You can break this down algebraically to find an interesting relationship:
    - realreturn = (1 + nominalreturn) / (1 + % change in inflation) - 1
- The point here is to evaluate the new purchasing power you gain from your investment growing
    - This is preferable to just calculating the new dollars you've earned
- Higher inflation = lower real returns (for a given % change in nominal price)

####*Video 1.6 - Annualizing Returns*

**A. Annualizing Returns**

- Annualizing is basically converting your period into years, compounding, and finding future value
- Compound annual rate of return for a monthly rate of return
    - *R~A~* = (1+*r~t~*)^(*t*) - 1
    
**B. Annualized two-year returns**

- What if you have an investment with a two-year return, and you want to find the CAGR?
- CAGR = (value~end~/value~start~)^(1/*t*)-1
    - where *t* is the number of years that passed between the beginning and end dates
    
**C. A Note on Continous Compounding**

- Continously compounded returns are additive
- So, if you have a monthly continuous return and you want to convert it to an annual return...
- ... you need to *multiply* the monthly cc return by 12
