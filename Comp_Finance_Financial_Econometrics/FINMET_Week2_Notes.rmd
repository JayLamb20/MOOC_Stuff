####*Video 2.1 - Introduction*

**A. Coverage**

- probability, random variables
- univariate distributions
- definition of distribution functions for discrete/contiuous random variables
- look at normal distribution
- risk concepts based on quantiles (VaR)
- look at linear measures of dependence --> correlation and covariance

####*Video 2.2 - Univariate Random Variables*

**A. Univariate Random Variables in the Context of Asset Returns**

- From today, return is not known with certainty
- a random variable is:
    - a variable that can take on a given set of values (called the sample space *S~x~*), where the likelihood of the values in *S~x~* is determined by the variable's probability distribution function (pdf)
- if price is random, then rate of return (a linear transformation of price) must also be random
- another example may be a dummy for changes (0 if price falls, 1 if it rises)

**B. Discrete Random Variables**

- the probability density function (pdf) of a discrete random variable X is a funciton such that p(x) = Pr(X = x)
- Sum of probabilities in sample space is 100%
- Bayesian statistics --> probabilities as representations of subjective beliefs
- frequency-based statistics --> probabilities arise from objective tests/simulations
