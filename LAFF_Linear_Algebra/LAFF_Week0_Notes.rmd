####*The MATLAB Environment*

**A. Starting Up**

- You can execute commands directly from the "command window"
- created variables on the right ("workspace")
- to create a script, click the "new script" button to open the MATLAB editor
- you can run scripts right from this editor
- active programs in this directory will be shown under "Current Folder" on the left

####*MATLAB Variables*

**A. Intro to Variables**

- you have to start by defining variables
- the single equal sign is the assignment operator
    -" the value on left is evaluated, then assigned to the thing on the left"
- variable names are case-sensitive and must start with a letter
- there are some system variables, for exampe ```pi```
- If matlab does not recognize the value on the RHS, it will error
- MATLAB evaluates line-by-line in sequental order
- a MATLAB command may be terminated with a semicolon
    - this suppresses output from MATLAB
- useful tips:
    - define data with square brackets --> ```x = [1 2 3 4]```
    - define functions of args with parentheses --> ```ans1 = mean(x)```
    - the comment character is the ```%``` character
    
####*MATLAB As a Calculator*

**A. MATLAB Representations of Mathematical Operators**

- be conscious of orders of operation
    - use parentheses carefully
- you can use the function ```exp(x)``` to compute an exponential function

####*Video 0.4.1 The Origin of MATLAB*

**A. The Origins**

- JH Wilkinson - mathematician in UK (built "Pilot Ace" computer in 1950s)
    - world's leading authority on matrix calculation in his time
- George Forsythe, John & Olga Todd --> UCLA math
- writing code --> "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" Niklaus Wirth
    - design of a parser for data types
- the first MATLAB was about 2000 lines of Fortran
- founder: "Cleve Moler"
- 80 functions in first version...8000 now
- MATLAB started as a simple matrix calculator
- Jack Little at Stanford saw potential of MATLAB for signal processing and control theory
    - Jack Little and Cleve Moler founded Matlab in early 80s
