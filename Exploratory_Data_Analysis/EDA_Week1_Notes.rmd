####*Video 1.1 Introduction*

**A. What the Class is About **

- this is about exploratory (pre-inference) analysis

####*Video 1.2 Principles of ANalytic Graphics*

**A. General Rules**

1. Show comparisons
    - evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another, competing hypothesis
2. Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
    - how is the system operating? How does the world work?
    - what is your "causal framework"?
3. Show multivariate data
    - show as much on a single plot as you can
    - "the real world is multivariate"
    - need to "escape flatland"
4. Integration of evidence
    - data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
    - don't let the tool (graphic device) drive the analysis
5. Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
    - a data graphic shoud tell a cmplete story that is credible
    - keep the code that made the plot
6. Content is king
    - if your story isn't interesting, graphs won't magically make it more interesting
    - start with the data and the story, then choose the appropriate plots
    
####*Video 1.3 Exploratory Graphs (pt 1)*

**A. What are Exploratory Graphs?**

- pretty much made for yourself
- why use them?
    - find patterns, understand properties, suggest modeling strategies
    - debug analysis
- made quickly, a large number are made
- the goal here is just for personal understanding of the data
- axes/legends cleaned up later
- color/size are primarily used for information
