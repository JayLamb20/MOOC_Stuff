####*Video 4.1 - Lists*

**A. Sequence Types in Python**

- the most common of these is the list type
- lists are in square brackets
    - empty: ```mylist = []```
    - not empty: ```mylist = ['hello','goodbye']```
    
**B. Accessing Lists**

- you can use ```len(my_list)``` to extract the number of list elements
- both lists and strings are sequences, so there is a lot of overlap in the functions you use
- you can use [] indexing (just like with strings) to get at certain elements
- unlike strings, lists are mutable
    - you can use indexing to change elements
- "good programmers keep their lists homogenous"
    - i.e. only one type per list

####*Video 4.2 - Keyboard Input*

**A. The Echo program**

- http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examples-keyboard_echo.py
- keyboard up and keyboard down events
- simplegui calls the draw handler 60x per second
- event handlers for the events tell Python what to do when certain events happen
- keys are mapped to integer "key codes"
    - to get that variable, use something like ```simpleguid.KEY_MAP["left"]```


####*Video 4.3 - Motion*

**A. A Bit of Calculus**

- speed ("velocity") = change in position per unit of time
- position = initial position + velocity * times
