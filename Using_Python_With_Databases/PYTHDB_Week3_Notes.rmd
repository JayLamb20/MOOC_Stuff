####*Video 3.1 - Designing a Data Model*

**A. Notes**

- this is an art form
- our goal it to avoid really bad mistakes and make something useful

**B. Building a Data Model**

- drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then figuring out how to represent the objects and their relationships
- basic rule: don't put the same string data in twice - use a relationship instead
- when there is one thing in the "real world", there should be one copy of that thing in the db
- strings are way more expensive to store than integers
- model the real world!
- with spreadsheets, you end up replicating data many many times
- where do we start? think about what the most essential thing is
- "the data model creates the features of the application"
    - you have to get the data model right for the application to have the capabilities you want
