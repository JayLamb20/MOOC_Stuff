<center> <h3>---------------------------------------</h3> </center>

####*Video 1.1 Introduction to Data Products*

**A. What is a Data Product?**

- an app, software, reproducible report based on data
- an R package would be a reproducible report too

**B. What We'll learn**

- How to use RStudio presenter
- a shiny app (web app)
- rCharts and interactive graphics

####*Video 1.2 Motivating Shiny*

**A. Three Problems**

- your software is hard to use
    - create an R package for installation?
- you want numbers updated automatically every month?
    - create a slidify presentation that pulls in new numbers
- web app for a prediction function?
    - make a Shiny app (even though you have minimal web app skills)

####*Video 1.3 Shiny 1 Introduction to Shiny*

**A. What is Shiny?**

- a platform for creating interactive R programs in a web page
- put up an algorithm where people can pick and click to use it
- use Shiny to create simple, yet powerful, web-based interactive data products in R
    - minimal dev cost
- Shiny is made by R Studio

**B. Some Mild Prerequisites**

- a little knowledge of html, css and js is very helpful
    - know html at the bare minimum
    - html gives web page structure and sectioning
    - css gives the style
    - js (JavaScript) gives you interactivity
- there are tons of tutorials online for these things
- Shiny uses bootstrap style (it looks nice, even on mobile)

**C. What Else is out there?**

- creating any solution requiring fairly deep knowledge of web client/server programming
- OpenCPU is a really neat project providing an API for calling R from web documents
    - he even hosts an OpenCPU server, but you can create your own
- you need a lot more knowledge of web programming for this

**D. Context**

- you created some stuff, let users on a website put in data and see what comes out

**E. Getting Started**

- install R
