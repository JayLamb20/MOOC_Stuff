####*Video 4.1 - Introduction to Decision Making*

**A. Decision Models**

- Why do I care?
    - Normative: make us better at deciding
    - Positive: predict behavior of others
- normative involves the word "should"

**B. Two Types of Models**

- multi-criterion models
- probabilistic

**C. Multi-Criterion Models**

- pick an "ideal" point? (intersection of multiple criterion)
- "spatial decision" = "how close it is to your preferences"
    - a spatial decision would be made under certainty

**D. Probabilistic**

- decision trees?
    - compute "value of information"
    - "if the uncertainty went away, would our decision change?"
    - kind of variable importance
    
####*Video 4.2 - Multi-Criterion decision Making*

**A. Main Idea**

- you have a bunch of choices along different dimensions
- qualitative: a "vote" by comparing relevant criteria
- quantitative: maybe more objective
    - maybe do the "voting" method, but with weights?
- we don't want models to tell us what to do
    - the goal is just to make better decisions

####*Video 4.3 - Spatial Choice Models*

**A. Main Idea**

- you have an "ideal point"
    - pick whatever is "closest" to that point
    - this is kind of how people vote, right?
    - you never get your ideal candidate

**B. Ramp It Up**

- Andrew Gelman ideological chart of Supreme Court justices
- think about taking "distances" along multiple dimensions (vectors of "differences")
- positive:
    - you can look at choices and see what someone's ideal point was
    - this is a "revealed preference" approach to the problem

####*Video 4.4 - Probability: The Basics*

**A. Intro to Probability**

- probabilities must have these properties:
    - probabilities must be in the set [0,1]
    - sum of all possible outcomes equals 1
    - if A subset B, then Prob(B) >= Prob(A)
- and outcome is a thing that can happen. An event is a subset of outcomes

**B. Classical Probabilities**

- Dice, cards, draws from a bag

**C. Frequency**

- we don't know the "pure" probabilities, but can make estimates on the basis of observerd frequencies
