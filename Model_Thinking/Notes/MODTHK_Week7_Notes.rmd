####*Video 7.1 - Tipping Points*

**A. Notes**

- "tipping" = small changes lead to big effects
- when people talk about tipping points, they mean "kinks in curves"
- a tipping point is a when a small change has a large effect
    - exponential growth can look like a tipping point, but it really isn't that
    - that's just the "inevitable process of growth"
- we're going to explore two models in this space
- types of tips:
    - direct tips: an action tips that same entity (battle to war)
    - contextual tips: environmental changes enable some other change
- tipping might be thought of as moving between Wolfram's four classes of system equlibria (stable, complex, random, repeating)

####*Video 7.2 - Percolation Models*

**A. How It Works**

- "the essence of modeling is to simplify things"
- the question: will rainwater percolate?
- this model can be applied to Forest Fires (see the model in NetLogo)
- the idea here is that water can only go from one open place to another:
    - think about a frog hopping across a fire through connected lilipads

**B. Fertility of Models**

- density of trees and relationship with fire spread
- could also be applied to bank failures
    - the density of lending relationships matters
- you might consider this in the context of country failures (e.g. sovereign default)

**C. Information Percolation**

- imagine a network of people
- transition probability - probability that when you hear something, you tell your friends
- the distribution of rumors is probably nonlinear
    - this is a result of information being spread through networks

**D. Innovation**

- why do we see a bunch of innovations in math and science all at once?
- think about it like "getting from point A to point B" by stitching together bits of knowledge
- think about innovation:
    - new technology starts "filling in intermediate squares"
    - at some point, the system tips and there are lots and lots of possible paths to the new invention
    - this explains a bunch of people inventing the same thing at about the same time

####*Video 7.3- Contagion Models 1: Diffusion*

**A. The SIS Model**

- SIS: "susceptible, infected, susceptible"
- SIR: "susceptible, infected, recovered"
- take some probability of transmission of the disease, probabilities of people with and without the disease meeting
- contact rate: how often do ANY people meet?
- the dynamics
    - early: few people who have it (can't spread fast)
    - middle: lots who have it, lots who don't (spreads fast)
    - end: lots who have it, few who don't (spread slows)
- diffusion equation:
    - $W_{t+1} = W_{t} + (Nc)\tau\frac{W_{t}}{N}(\frac{N-W_{t}}{N})$
- this is NOT a tipping point
    - this is natural diffusion
- just because you see a kink doesn't mean there's a tip

####*Video 7.4 - Contagion Models 2: SIS Model*

**A. The Difference**

- unlike in pure diffusion, in this model you can become susceptible (second S) again after having had the disease once
- the equation is now:
    - $W_{t+1} = W_{t} + (Nc)\tau\frac{W_{t}}{N}(\frac{N-W_{t}}{N}) - aW_{t}$
    - where $aW_{t}$ captures the people who get re-infected
- re-written:
