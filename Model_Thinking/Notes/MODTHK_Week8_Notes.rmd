####*Reading 1: Economic Growth*

[Economic Growth](http://modelthinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/r8growth.pdf)

**A. A Model of Growth**

- the models have three parts: labor, physical capital, output
- output = f(labor, physical capital)
    - if invested, output gets turned into more physical capital
    - "the more output turned into physical capital, the more productive labor will be. However, any output that's invested cannot be consumed."
- why use fixed rules in growth models?
    - models with fixed rules are easier to analyze
    - by varying the fixed rules we'll gain some insights into what a model optimal rule will look like
- linearity tends to become the exception not the rule as models have more moving parts

**B. A Simple Growth Model**

- you probably get decreasing returns to scale as you increase capital
    - i.e. production is described by a concave function
- the basic model has just two equations:
    - $O_{t} = f(K) = AK_{t}^{\alpha}$
    - $K_{t+1} = K_{t} + I_{t} - dK_{t}$
    - $C_{t} = O_{t} - I_{t}$
    - $I_{t} = sO_{t}$
    
**C. The Irony of Growth**

- to continue to have growth, the society needs to build more and more machines
- the added benefit of having more machines decreases (decreasing returns!)
- "so long as savings exceeds depreciation, the capital stock will grow as will output"
- two observations:
    1. the cost of depreciation increases linearly in the number of machines
    2. Output increases at a declining rate in the number of machines
- where does growth stop?
    - at the point where the amount of capital produces a level of output that implies depreciation equal to investment
    - this is the "long run equilibrium"
- solving for LR equilibrium:
    - $20\sqrt{M^{*}} = 0.1M^{*}$
- output increases linearly in the savings rate:
    - a country that saves twice as much will have twice as much output
    - "the number of machines in equilibrium increases with the square of the savings rate and output depends on the square root of the number of machines"
- so what is the irony? "The basic grwoth model eventually resutls in a fixed level of output, i.e. no growth
