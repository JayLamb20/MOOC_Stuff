####*Reading 1: Economic Growth*

[Economic Growth](http://modelthinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/r8growth.pdf)

**A. A Model of Growth**

- the models have three parts: labor, physical capital, output
- output = f(labor, physical capital)
    - if invested, output gets turned into more physical capital
    - "the more output turned into physical capital, the more productive labor will be. However, any output that's invested cannot be consumed."
- why use fixed rules in growth models?
    - models with fixed rules are easier to analyze
    - by varying the fixed rules we'll gain some insights into what a model optimal rule will look like
- linearity tends to become the exception not the rule as models have more moving parts

**B. A Simple Growth Model**

- you probably get decreasing returns to scale as you increase capital
    - i.e. production is described by a concave function
- the basic model has just two equations:
    - $O_{t} = f(K) = AK_{t}^{\alpha}$
    - $K_{t+1} = K_{t} + I_{t} - dK_{t}$
    - $C_{t} = O_{t} - I_{t}$
    - $I_{t} = sO_{t}$
    
**C. The Irony of Growth**

- to continue to have growth, the society needs to build more and more machines
- the added benefit of having more machines decreases (decreasing returns!)
- "so long as savings exceeds depreciation, the capital stock will grow as will output"
- two observations:
    1. the cost of depreciation increases linearly in the number of machines
    2. Output increases at a declining rate in the number of machines
- where does growth stop?
    - at the point where the amount of capital produces a level of output that implies depreciation equal to investment
    - this is the "long run equilibrium"
- solving for LR equilibrium:
    - $20\sqrt{M^{*}} = 0.1M^{*}$
- output increases linearly in the savings rate:
    - a country that saves twice as much will have twice as much output
    - "the number of machines in equilibrium increases with the square of the savings rate and output depends on the square root of the number of machines"
- so what is the irony? "The basic growth model eventually results in a fixed level of output, i.e. no growth
- eventually, you are investing just enough to replace depreciated stock, and the model stalls
- how do we break out? innovation (technological progress)

**D. The Solow Growth Model**

- differences:
    - applies to any amount of labor
    - assumes labor and capital have diminishing returns to scale
    - assumes a technological sophistication parameter (TFP) that changes over time
- The core Solow model output function looks like this:
    - Output: $F(K, L, A(t)) = A(t)L^{\beta}K^{1-\beta} with \beta \in (0,1)$
- the exponents of K and L sum to 1
    - "if both labor and capital are doubled, output will also double"
    - this gives "constant returns to scale"
- a second contribution to growth:
    - *the improved technology creates the posisbility of investing in more capital to produce even more growth*
- remember that equilibrium comes at the point where "the loss due to depreciation equals new investment in capital"
- the innovation multiplier = "Innovation, changes in A(t) increase output both by directly making labor and capital more productive and by creating incentives to invest in more capital
- the model does produce sustained growth, but it will be slowed by replacement time

**E. The Catchup Model of Growth**

- the natural drags on growth cry "nonlinearity" in growth forecasts
    - extrapolation is not going to work here
- "the advantage of backwardness" --> the less capital a country has today, the faster it can grow
    - the country is not yet experiencing severe slowdowns in the marginal productivity of capital

**F. The Limits of Extraction**

- Schumpeter's creative destruction (the replacement of old technologies with new) "lies at the core of growth"
    - "the car replaced the horse, and that change destroyed hundreds of supporting industries at the same time that it created hundreds more"
- extraction will limit growth and innovation will drive it
- prosperous countries have strong central governmetns that promote pluralism:
    1. the strong center creates stability (if you buy stuff you keep it)
    2. pluralism prevents extraction by elites
    3. puralism plus stability promotes innovation and creative destruction

**G. Lags Between Innovation and Growth**

- shocks to technology have two effects:
    - the direct effect increases growth by making the economy more productive with what it has
    - the indirect effect induces further investment (takes longer)

**H. Endogenous Growth**

- endogenous = produced within the model
- Weitzman - "generation and recombination of ideas"
    - diversity in the product market and the labor market result in more ideas that can bump into one another producing ever more growth

**I. Summary**

- the simple models presented here give two explanations for growth:
    - growth from investment
    - growth from innovation
- on model fertility:
    - consider starting with existing models, applying them to other domains, and then taking guidance from where exactly they and their assumptions fail
